# SQL

The purpose of this repository is to show a sample of my SQL techniques and abilities.

These queries are based on queries I wrote while in previous positions. 

To respect confidentiality, the code below does not contain any database, table, or column name used in any of my previous positions.

These tasks and queries involve a hypothetical company that delivers cakes and pies to individuals in offices internationally.

The schema of the hypothetical company database is available upon request.

Task2_Query2 : 179 lines
Task3_Query3 : 154 lines
Task4_Query4 : 68 lines
Task5_Query5 : 126 lines
